# MagicLearningJava: a machine learning library #
MagicLearning is a small library to develop maximum entropy model based classifier in java.

## Getting starting ##
Before start your project, take a look at our small example. This basic example illustrates how to create models to recognize the text language.

## Key Features ##
### Generate model: *Maximize* ###
Builds a model with a full dataset (no validation).

### Generate and test model: *Validator* ###
Builds a model with a part of dataset and evaluates it with the second part.

### Generate model and cross validate it: *CrossValidator* ###
Divides dataset in samples and tests every sample to get better average.

### Predict content: *Predictor* ###
When a model is built, the library can be used to make prediction on data.
